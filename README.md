# *Plov*er diction*ary* generation made ~~easy~~er

## TODOs
* Make this even more system independent by allowing the user to specify another system. This is most likely makes sense together with associated `mypy` types, though they are of course not necessary as they are only needed for type checking, and can be specified to be `None` for code that doesn't use `mypy`.
* Make this an installabe Python package and put it on the PyPI
* Document it.
